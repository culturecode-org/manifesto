# Our Value: What We Believe and Do

We believe programming is more than just writing code. It's about **thinking,
questioning, and solving with intention.**

We believe learning isn't about consuming faster, but about **understanding
better.**

And we believe every tool or technology must be put to the test of judgment,
not blind fanaticism.

That's why, at culturecode, we:
* Propose bi-weekly challenges and projects to **think with our hands**.
* Offer weekly live sessions to explore technologies **critically and
  playfully**.
* Foster a community where every viewpoint is valid and respected, but also
  **challenged.**
* Value timeless concepts, but also analyze the present with an **open mind**.
