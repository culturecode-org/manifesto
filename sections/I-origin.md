# Origin

### The Root of "Culture"

The word **culture** comes from the Latin *colere*, meaning to **cultivate**.
It originally referred to working the soil—shaping the land through consistent
care. Over time, it evolved to describe the cultivation of the mind, spirit,
and behavior.

Today, culture also means a shared space of meaning—a field where ideas are
planted, perspectives are exchanged, and values are nurtured.

### The Core of "Code"

The word **code** comes from the Latin *codex*, meaning a written collection or
book. It originally referred to wooden tablets and later to organized bodies of
law or knowledge.

Today, code refers to structured systems of symbols and instructions—the
languages we design to communicate with machines and give shape to logic.

**culturecode** grows from this combined root: it's not just about programming,
but about **cultivating technical thought as a living, shared practice.**
