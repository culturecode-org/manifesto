# Definition: What is culturecode?

culturecode is a community for people who want to explore programming as a
**deep practice**, not just a list of technologies to consume. It's about
learning to solve problems with sound judgment, understanding concepts clearly,
and **thinking critically** about what we build with software.

We're not a top-down school. We're a **horizontal learning network** where
knowledge is shared, the "why" behind the "how" is explored, and technical
judgment is sharpened. Everyone contributes at their own level and moves at
their own pace, but **the ground is cultivated together.**
