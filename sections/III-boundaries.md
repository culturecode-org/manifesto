# Boundaries: What culturecode is Not

culturecode is not just another academy with prerecorded courses or promises of
instant productivity.

**It's not a container for fleeting trends.** There are no incentives to praise
tools we don't believe in, or to shy away from critique where it's needed.

**It's not an extension of corporations, sponsors, or commercial interests.**
Ideas are explored purely on their merit, not on who's backing them. The
important thing is to keep our practice clean, critical, and purposeful.

**We don't optimize for hype; we optimize for understanding.** If something
works, we ask why. If it doesn't, we say so.
